# Music Player Application

## Overview

This is a React-based music player application, developed using Vite. It offers a user-friendly interface created with Material-UI and includes several key components:

- **MusicPlayer**: Manages the playback of songs.
- **SongRow**: Represents individual song entries with playback controls and information.
- **SongList**: A list view of `SongRow` components, serving as the playlist.
- **MusicUploadForm**: Enables users to upload music files in `.mp3` or `.wav` formats.
- **PlayAllButton**: Allows playing all songs in the playlist.
- **CopyrightNotice**: Shows copyright information.

## State Management

The application uses React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing state:

- **MusicPlayer**: Controls the current song and play/pause actions.
- **SongRow**: Manages play status, volume, and track progress.
- **MusicUploadForm**: Manages file upload and validation.
- **PlayAllButton**: Initiates playback of all songs without internal state management.

## Running the Application Locally
